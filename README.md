# Real-estate-price-prediction
This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive implementation of linear regression for real estate price prediction. By leveraging a carefully curated dataset and applying linear regression techniques, this project aims to deliver accurate predictions for real estate prices, assisting buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.
## Key Features
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Gain insights into the real estate dataset by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.

- **Feature Engineering:** Utilize domain knowledge to engineer relevant features that can enhance the predictive power of the linear regression model, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, proximity to amenities, and more.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Implement and train a linear regression model using the processed dataset. Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

- **Model Interpretation:** Examine the coefficients of the linear regression model to interpret the impact of each feature on the predicted real estate prices. Gain insights into which factors contribute the most to price fluctuations.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the linear regression model by optimizing hyperparameters, such as learning rate, regularization parameters, and feature selection techniques, to improve prediction accuracy.
  
- **Model Deployment:** Explore options for deploying the trained linear regression model, enabling it to be used in real-world scenarios. Examples include developing a web application, creating APIs, or integrating the model into existing software systems.
